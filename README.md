# Shimano WebBLE

A single-file Web Bluetooth diagnostic and experimental session-authentication
console for Shimano STEPS. No configuration or firmware changes are implemented.

**Live site:** https://galah92.github.io/shimano-webble/

## Use

Open the site in Chrome on Android, enable Bluetooth, make the Shimano endpoint
discoverable, and tap **Connect Shimano**. The page subscribes to 2AF3 indications
and probes 2AF4, 2AF6, and 2AF7 without application writes.

To test session access, enter the six-digit passkey configured in E-TUBE and tap
**Authenticate session**. This sends the two reconstructed authentication
messages, waits for their acknowledgements, then waits 500 ms and checks whether
2AF7 identifies the SC-E7000. If the read fails, it sends the captured `FF 00`
setup command to 2AFF once, waits another 500 ms, and checks again. The passkey is used locally, cleared after the attempt, and never
saved or logged. **Copy log** exports the diagnostic results for analysis.

Build .4 verified both authentication stages and SC-E7000 identification on the
real bike after the captured setup command. If authentication fails, reconnect
before retrying.

In build .5, tap **Identify drive unit** after session verification. It queries
the model and firmware through 2AFE/2AFD, with no configuration changes. This
minimal transport sequence still needs live validation; share the log even if
it times out. The supplied capture's motor fields decode differently from the
handoff, so the app reports the returned values rather than assuming E7000 / 4.7.1.

## Develop

Edit `index.html`; there is no build step or runtime dependency installation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/galah92/shimano-webble.git
cd shimano-webble
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open http://localhost:8000 for local UI development. Use the HTTPS site for
phone testing; a plain HTTP LAN address does not provide the required secure
context for Web Bluetooth.

GitHub Pages publishes the repository root from `main`. Push changes to `main`
to deploy; check the repository's Actions tab for the Pages build result.
`.nojekyll` keeps the site as plain static files.

For simulated browser tests, use Python with Playwright and its Chromium browser
installed, then run `python tests/browser.py`. No Bluetooth hardware is needed.

## Source and handoff

See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for verified evidence, protocol details,
firmware limitations, and remaining live checks.

The original HTML and historical handoff notes came from
`shimano_webble_with_handoff.html`. Their original read-only description predates
the explicit authentication experiment in build `2026-09-09.3`.

Keep passkeys, device identifiers, bugreports, and raw captures outside this
public repository. Earlier diagnostic builds logged the passkey via 2AF8;
keep those old exported logs private.
